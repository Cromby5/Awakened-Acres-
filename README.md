This is a new repositry, migrated from the old one as git lfs had to be removed to avoid server costs.

Few Notes that I hope are helpful to anyone reading.

Last1ScenePanic is the scene the itch build is on. 
The reason for this is there is a bug I couldnt solve with additive scenes only present in the build causing a crash upon load and it should still work fine in editor.
The additive scenes really helped seperate the areas and its a bit lost when shoved into one scene for the build to work as the structure got even more mixed up.
 
To read the dialogue files you can download inky at https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/
Using it has been really helpful and seems very good to continue with.

Any free/paid assets used can be found in the PlaceHolders/ThirdParty folder

If playing in editor you may notice upon exit a null reference that refers to the cut save/load system, 
it does not affect anything as the file is not created so a new game is started each time instead

I am aware some of the code is bad and I can have fun knowing I probably won't go back to this to fix it
