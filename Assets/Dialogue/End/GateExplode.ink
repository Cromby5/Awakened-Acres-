Finally! I can use this key to open the gate #speaker:Player #playerPortrait:player_active #npcPortrait:default

I don't think so! #speaker:Seed Sorceress #playerPortrait:player_grey #npcPortrait:witch_maskactive 
<b>BANG</b> #event:GateExplode #speaker: #playerPortrait:default #npcPortrait:default
Try getting through now! #speaker:Seed Sorceress #playerPortrait:player_grey #npcPortrait:witch_maskactive  

What are we supposed to do now? #speaker:Player #playerPortrait:player_active #npcPortrait:default

Remember what I showed you! If she thinks she can blow up the gate, we'll just blow up what's left! #speaker:Cherry #playerPortrait:player_grey #npcPortrait:cherry_active
Show her who's boss! #event:ResetGateCam
