Dear Niece,
It’s your uncle here, I wanted to let you know that I have decided to leave town for some time after having an argument with you aunt. We agreed that we need some time apart.
If it’s not too much to ask I am in urgent need of somebody to take care of my precious farm. If you could please do me a favour I would really appreciate it, I trust that you will be able to do a good job.
Please consider my request, we need you!
